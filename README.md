# M4_NN_0
try

The MAPE scores have a relatively big variation. Before this repo, I have written a test code and in that project the errors were substantially  lower.
I am not sure what could cause such a problem. It seems to me, there is a mistake around scaling and inverse transforming the results. 

I was expecting 4 to 8% errors, but sometimes this expectation does not hold. 

I am also adding the already split csv files, so probing could be done easily on a few data files before actually training on 100.000 files.
